# Models

The `models` folder contains Jupyter notebooks and Python files that were used to develop and explore various models for the NTTData Healthcare Challenge project.

## Contents

### 1. ARIMA.ipynb
- Jupyter notebook focused on ARIMA modeling for time series analysis. It explores and implements the ARIMA model for predictive analysis.

### 2. meta_prophet.ipynb
- Notebook utilizing the Prophet model for time series forecasting and analysis. It demonstrates the implementation and analysis of the Prophet model.

### 3. model_trimestral.ipynb
- Notebook detailing a model that groups the data by trimester. It provides an approach that aggregates data into trimesters for analysis.

### 4. model_trimestral.py
- Python file containing an XGBoost ensemble model. This file holds the implementation of an XGBoost model that works with trimester-aggregated data.

### 5. xgboost_categories.ipynb
- Jupyter notebook showcasing an XGBoost model utilizing the "CATEGORIES" column. It demonstrates the use of XGBoost on data categorized under specific columns.

### 6. xgboost_grid.ipynb
- Jupyter notebook detailing the first XGBoost model and a grid search to optimize its parameters. It explores the initial model development and parameter tuning using a grid search approach.

## Usage

Each notebook and Python file presents a specific model or modeling approach used in the project. Open the notebooks in a Jupyter environment to understand the model development, implementation, and analysis.

### Running the Notebooks/Files
- Open the desired notebook in a Jupyter environment.
- Execute the cells sequentially to understand the model creation and analysis.
- Follow the commented instructions and code explanations within the notebooks.

## Purpose

These notebooks and files document the creation and exploration of different models used for predictive analysis and forecasting in the NTTData Healthcare Challenge project.
